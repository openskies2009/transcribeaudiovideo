# Audio/Video Field Recordings Automation
Bash Script: MP3 to Text Conversion with Whisper

Welcome to the Audio/Video Field Recordings Automation repository! This project is designed to streamline and automate the process of logging and categorizing audio and video recordings. Built with tools like ffmpeg, shell scripting, and Whisper, it provides a range of features to enhance your recording workflow.

Features
Transcription

Convert audio/video files to text (TXT) or SubRip Subtitle (SRT) files.
Detect multiple languages and translate transcriptions as needed.
Ideal for quickly reading summaries of interviews or meetings instead of listening to lengthy recordings.
Burnt-In Transcriptions

Create video transcriptions embedded directly on a smaller copy of the video.
Makes it easy to reference spoken content directly from the video.
Smart File Naming

Automatically rename files based on custom phrases (e.g., 'take number', 'the date', 'my name is').
Simplifies organization for multi-camera and audio shoots, especially when files are not in any particular order.
