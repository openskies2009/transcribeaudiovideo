File Conversion: Converts non-MP3 files (e.g., .mp4, .wav) to temporary MP3 files using FFmpeg.

Whisper Integration: Runs Whisper for transcription with English language support and outputs .srt subtitle files.

Multithreading: Utilizes up to 4 threads for faster processing.

Automatic Directory Creation: Creates the output directory if it doesnâ€™t already exist.
